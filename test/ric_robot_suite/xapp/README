This directory contains an XApp used to support RIC testing; its
primary purpose is things like RMR message handling which aren't
easily managed in Robot itself, and to provide a way to test XApp
deployment and point-to-point message flow without depending on the
functionality of any particular XApp.

To build the XApp container, do

$ doocker build -f docker/robot-xapp/Dockerfile .

from the ric_robot_suite directory.  The XApp can be deployed via the
RIC Application Manager using the schema.json and config.json files in
this directory.
