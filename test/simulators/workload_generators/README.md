There are two directories in this "workload_generators" folder. Each directory
holds one type of workload generator. In "internal_testing", there are source
code and config files for a work load generator testing RIC internals such as
the RMR messaging system latency. In "e2e_testing", there are source code and
config files for a work load generator testing the end to end performance of a
RIC platform.
